This repo contains unused Advanced Java labs for Reflection & Multithreading.

They are more difficult and have not been thoroughly reviewed for distribution. They also do not have CLI/res integration. In order to run a lab, you will need to either use 'cd <labname>' to navigate your terminal to a lab directory and 'cd ..' to navigate back to the root directory, and then run the 'mvn test' command to run all tests and produce test output, or you can open an individual lab's directory with your IDE and either run MVN test or use the testing plugin on your IDE to run tests graphically.
